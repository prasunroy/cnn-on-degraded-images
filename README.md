## Installation
#### Step 1: Install [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads)
#### Step 2: Install dependencies
```
pip install numpy scipy pandas matplotlib opencv-python tensorflow keras
```
```
pip install git+https://github.com/prasunroy/mlutils.git
```
>For detailed instructions on TensorFlow installation with GPU support refer to the official [*TensorFlow documentation*](https://www.tensorflow.org/install).

## Dataset
### Synthetic Digits
This dataset contains 12,000 synthetically generated images of English digits embedded on random backgrounds. The images are generated with varying fonts, colors, scales and rotations. The backgrounds are randomly selected from a [*subset*](http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/val2017.zip) of [*COCO*](http://cocodataset.org) dataset. The dataset is available at [*Kaggle*](https://www.kaggle.com/prasunroy/synthetic-digits).

Downloading through [*Kaggle API*](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api) `kaggle datasets download -d prasunroy/synthetic-digits`

### Natural Images
This dataset contains 6,899 images from 8 distinct classes compiled from various sources. The classes include airplane, car, cat, dog, flower, fruit, motorbike and person. The dataset is available at [*Kaggle*](https://www.kaggle.com/prasunroy/natural-images).

Downloading through [*Kaggle API*](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api) `kaggle datasets download -d prasunroy/natural-images`

## Training Models
>The *`configurations`* section of a train script defines various training parameters. These parameters can be changed by directly modifying the script before training.

#### Training a deep convolutional neural network
```
python train_deepcnn.py
```

#### Training a capsule network
```
python train_capsnet.py
```

## Testing Models
>The *`configurations`* section of a test script defines various testing parameters. These parameters can be changed by directly modifying the script before testing.
```
python test.py
```
